# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

get frontend running locally and test at http://localhost:3000/
create frontend dockerfile, build image, run container

get backend running locally and test at http://localhost:4567/api/activities/home
create backend dockerfile, build image, run container

tried making changes and they did not reload - this may come with the docker compose
and the var mount or something? that will be my next step to investigate

ok I've started up my docker compose
(first I replaced the env vars to \* instead of the gitpod urls)
it's up - can i make a live change now?
Yes

Ok, next steps are going to involve setting up the db and go beyond what was in the first video.

added postgres and dynamodb entries to docker compose file

created gitignore file and added docker folder, .DS_Store

installed postgresql client with home brew
Installed SQLTools extension and connected to local database

interesting things
-t name
resolves to -t name:latest
so latest is like the default tag

docker extension in vs code
so easy to exec into running container

"Ports" as tab in vs code terminal - does it relate to this extension?
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh

running docker compose up by right clicking on docker compose file (does not run detached tho)

TODO:

homework tasks I'd like to do

Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
