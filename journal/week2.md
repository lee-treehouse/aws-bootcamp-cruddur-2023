# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

Honeycomb first

1. add opentelemetry dependencies to requirements.text and pip3 install in backend.
2. login to honeycomb
3. set honeycomb env vars and confirm them with `env` or `env | grep HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME` and `env | grep HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`
4. review envs - unset `HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME` and specify it for the service consistently
5. discussion of env variables and parallel shells vs sub shells - interesting discussion
